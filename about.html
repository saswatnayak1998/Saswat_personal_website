    Work Experience:<br>
    • Achieved a 40% improvement in query times for the in-house knowledge base when shifted to a graph architecture(Neo4j) from a relational database(MySQL).
• Led a team of interns to extract patient data from progress notes via computational and statistical methods.
Successfully optimized the patient data update process, achieving a 90% reduction in time required and a 50%
decrease in associated costs by implementing NLP solutions(NLTK, Spacy, RoBERTa) and using auto-encoders
for anomaly detection.
• Designed and implemented RESTful APIs to facilitate CRUD operations, enhancing data interchange and system
integration for healthcare analytics platforms.
• Employed DevOps best practices to streamline project workflows, resulting in a 30% increase in deployment
efficiency and improved collaboration across development and operations teams.
• Learnt the adoption of containerization with Docker and orchestrated microservices using Kubernetes, achieving
high scalability and reliability in data analysis applications.
• Collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop robust data analytics solutions, driving improvements in
patient care and operational decision-making.<br>
Research Work:<br>
• Conducted comprehensive computational research on the design principles of 3D Photonic Crystals, filtering
candidates on the basis of their ease of self assembly, to be used in semiconductor research. Used Python, Git,
WolframAlpha, and other advanced computational libraries.
• Introduced novel explainable descriptors that significantly outperform traditional symmetry-based descriptors
in machine learning tasks. These advancements achieved a notable 50% improvement in the effectiveness of
identifying and categorizing photonic crystal structures, as substantiated by an F1-score enhancement from 48%
to 94%.<br>
Project Experience:<br>
Project Experience
• Engineered a high-performance filesystem backed by relational databases, featuring a user-friendly web interface
for comprehensive CRUD operations. Spearheaded the development of an intuitive visualization tool, enabling
users to effortlessly explore directories and subdirectories through a dynamic tree structure. Depoyed on Vercel.
• Leveraged protein and peptide data from Parkinson’s Disease patients to develop predictive models for disease
progression severity, enhancing understanding and potential early intervention strategies.
• Molecular Dynamics Simulation: Developed a Molecular Dynamics simulation from the ground up using only
NumPy, modeling particle behavior in a confined space with Lennard-Jones potential to analyze interactions
and dynamics.<br>
Teaching Experience<br>
• Served as a Teaching Assistant for the Transport Phenomena Lab, guiding undergraduates through practical
experiments and equipment usage to enhance their understanding of core concepts.
• Provided in-depth explanations and clarifications on the theoretical foundations of experiments, ensuring students’ ability to apply knowledge in practical settings.
• Addressed student inquiries regarding equipment functionality, troubleshooting issues to facilitate seamless lab
operations and enhance learning outcomes.<br>
Machine Learning Intern Nov 2020 - Dec 2020
Ushur Bengaluru, India
• Designed and implemented an advanced algorithm combining Google Tesseract OCR with rule-based techniques
to accurately extract customer data from insurance claim documents.
• This innovative approach not only streamlined data.<br>
PUBLICATIONS
Computational Fluid Dynamics Published a research paper in Chemical Engineering Science.<br>
EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
• Actively play Tennis, Pickleball and Counter Strike.<br>
Questions: Am i free? Answer: Right now, I am working on developing more live projects so as to become more skilled for the corporate world and I am really enjoying this process. I have learnt a lot of new stuff on NLP, Computer Vision, etc.
